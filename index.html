			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I am a software developer who enjoys taking an idea from concept to fruition. A strong analytical thinker, I have long valued challenges and hard work. I am drawn to logic and have found my critical thinking skills to be an effective tool for creative and practical endeavors alike. <br><br>

				I greatly enjoy solving problems that have positive and practical impacts on members of my community. I did this as a teenager as a Boy Scout, culminating in my receiving the Eagle Scout award. Altruistic values instilled in me during that time greatly influenced me, and I see software development and the growing technology industry as providing the tools to help improve quality of life for people the world round. I also learned how to effectively work with a team, and I enjoy that I have been able to use that skill within the agile development environment. I prefer collaborative work, especially with regards to programming. I was blessed with great opportunities to travel to many different countries while in college, through a study abroad program, Semester at Sea. That experience showed me the beauty and value of different perspectives, further deepening my belief that collaborative efforts are the most effective way to approach problems. <br><br>

				Through my experience working in sales for a small food start up, I developed customer and personal management skills that I look forward to applying to my career in software development. My experience working with a development team to build the website for this start up was my first real introduction to software development. I have the perspective of a product owner, and it has been incredible interesting to approach the same work from the perspective of a development team member. <br><br>

				I am excited to join and contribute to a development team!<br>

			<h5>Stock Up!</h5>
			<p>
				<strong><a href="https://github.com/hfrankst/NSS-frontend-capstone">'Stock Up'</a></strong> is a single page application, with basic CRUD functionality, using AngularJS and an interactive map through LeafletJS to show users grocery store deals and promotions.  The app makes API calls to Firebase to pull in dummy data promotions, and display the store offering the deals on a map.
